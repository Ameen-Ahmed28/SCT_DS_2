**Titanic EDA Analysis**
This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, insights, and trends related to passenger demographics, survival rates, and ticket classes. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, visualize, and interpret the data.

Key objectives include identifying factors influencing survival (e.g., age, gender, class) and handling missing data effectively. The analysis highlights correlations and uses visualizations to simplify complex relationships.

The insights gained can inform predictive models for survival prediction or enhance understanding of the dataset. This project is suitable for data science beginners and enthusiasts exploring EDA techniques.
